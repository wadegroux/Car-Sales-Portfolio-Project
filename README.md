## Introduction
This data analysis project demonstrates my proficiency in extracting valuable insights from a comprehensive car sales dataset sourced from Kaggle. Similar to my prior work on US traffic accidents, where the dataset spanned from February 2016 to March 2023, the current analysis dives into the dynamic world of car sales. Through a combination of critical thinking, meticulous data cleaning, thorough analysis, and effective visualization, this project aims to uncover patterns and trends within the provided dataset.

The goal of this analysis is to extract actionable insights from the provided dataset, shedding light on critical aspects such as popular car models, customer demographics, and regional variations in sales. By addressing these key questions, we aim to empower stakeholders in the automotive industry to optimize marketing strategies, tailor inventory management, and enhance overall business performance.

## Objective
The primary objective of this data analysis project is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the car sales dataset and offer actionable insights for strategic decision-making in the competitive landscape of the automotive industry. This project showcases the application of critical data analysis skills and tools, including SQL for initial cleaning and Tableau for detailed visual analysis.
